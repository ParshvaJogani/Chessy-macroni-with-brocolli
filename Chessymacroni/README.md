No neapoltian meal is ever complete without a dish of macroni. Macroni
was invented in this region and word today has almost generic for
dried pasta. Altough known elsewhere in Italy as "maccheroni", macroni is 
is the spelling used in Naples and throughout Europe.

Macroni tossed in a cream and cheese sauce with fresh brocoli is a delightful
recipe. Toss and serve this pasta immediately as it does not taste very well when
it is re-heated.
